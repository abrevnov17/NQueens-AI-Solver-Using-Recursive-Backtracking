# NQueens-AI-Solver-Using-Recursive-Backtracking
This was an assignment that I completed for my Advanced Computer Science class in collaboration with two other students. The solution to this assignment outputed a chessboard of nxn size with n-queens positioned on it such that no one queen was able to attack any of the other queens (for some given n).

This assignment involved recursive backtracking and was written in Java that was run from Terminal.
